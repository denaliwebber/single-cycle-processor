Program: ARM Single-Cycle Processor Implementation in Digital

Description: A single-cycle processor implementation of a subset of the ARMv7 instruction set using digital logic Digital. This includes: quadratic calculation, sum of an array, find maxium value in an array, fibonacci iterative, and fibonacci recursive.

How to use: By changing the constant value that selects a ROM file on the ROM_programs component, you can select which program to run. A textbox explains which value will test which associated instructions. By opening the ROM_programs circuit, there is a display of information including expected output for each ROM file. To test own files, you can add another ROM component and load a hex file into it.
